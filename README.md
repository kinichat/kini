# kini

Oh hi! Ermmm... how is your day going? Yeah, ermmm... here you can find some kini resources like... kini's protocol(`PROTOCOL.md`), kini's logo and, ermmm, stuff.

If you are looking for kini client/server source code, you should be looking for it in kinichat/kiniclient and kinichat/kiniserver instead.

## Wanna help?

(Wait, someone really wants to help? I wasn't expecting that...)

Just contact anyone of us for more information:
- segfaultdev(segfaultdev@protonmail.com)

(You can add your name here if you contributed to any of kini's repositories)
