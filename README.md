# kini

(Oh hi! Ermmm... how is your day going?)

kini(recursive acronym of "Kini Is Not IRC") is a simple chat protocol, client and server designed to be simple to use, decentralized and fast, while supporting modern features like markup languages and media files.

## This repository

Yeah, ermmm... here you can find some kini resources like... kini's protocol(`PROTOCOL.md`), kini's logo and, ermmm, stuff.

If you are looking for kini client/server source code, you should be looking for it in kinichat/kiniclient and kinichat/kiniserver instead.

## Wanna help?

(Wait, someone really wants to help? I wasn't expecting that...)

Just contact anyone of us for more information:
